Write a C++ recursive solution to create a copy of all even data items in an array of linear linked lists. Return the number of items copied over.

Public Prototype:
int make_new(table & copy);

Private Prototype:
int make_new(node ** & copy, node * source[]);

Write a C++ recursive solution to move the first node in the first linked list to right before the LAST 2 encountered in the array of linear linked lists.  Minimize traversals. Return the number of times a 2 was encountered.

Public Prototype:
int move_to_last();

Private Prototype:
int move_to_last(node * head[]);
